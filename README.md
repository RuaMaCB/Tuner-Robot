A Soft-Robotic Auto-Tuner for String Instruments

This project presents the design and prototyping of a universal robotic tuning device capable of automatically adjusting the pitch of various string instruments. By integrating a soft robotic gripper, a flexible transmission mechanism, and a pitch detection module based on microphone input, the system can adapt to different tuning pegs and provide real-time automatic tuning.
